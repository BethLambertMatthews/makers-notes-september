## Tuesday 28 September

9.30: Peer group

10.00: - workshop about domain modelling with Alice. "Modelling is an essential skill as a developer, as it allows you to plan code you’ll write, and communicate what you’ll do, before you even start writing the code"

Looked at using the diagram.codes website [https://playground.diagram.codes/d/class\_diag](https://playground.diagram.codes/d/class_diag)

```text
#basic class definition with field and method grouping
CLASS "Cohort" as Cohort:
-"students"
+"add(student)"
+"student_list()"
+"present_student_count()"

CLASS "Student" as Student:
-"name"
-"present?"
+"sign_in()"
+"sign_out()"

# class relation
Cohort-Student
```

Worked with Tom and Kirsty, looking at book / library user stories.
