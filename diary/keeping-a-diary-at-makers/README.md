# ðŸ“š Keeping a diary at Makers

Makers encourage reflection as part of learning. 

## Tracking your learning: 

Each day, we should be concentrating on the following:

1. **What is your focus/goal?**
2. **What will you do to move towards feeling confident you have achieved this?**
3. **How will you know you have done it well?**

Please share these three things daily so that your coach may give feedback.

## Example: for Friday 24 Sept 

**Goal:** Finalise my tracking system so that I have something straightforward. \(Currently I donâ€™t remember to fill it in every day.\)  
**Plan:** Set up a Trello board. Transfer existing notes to either GitHub or GitBook.  
**Measure:** Share my link with another apprentice / Roi and get their feedback.
